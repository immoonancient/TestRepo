# 这个太重了我拿下来一样一样的介绍
This tray is too heavy. Let me put it down and introduce them one by one


00:00:11.250,00:00:14.025
# 这个叫棒菜看起来像莴笋
This is called "Bang Cai" (literally "stick vegetable") and it looks like celtuce


00:00:14.025,00:00:16.450
# 一根（小的）的话大概有一斤多
(A small one) weighs about 1 Jin (500g)


00:00:16.450,00:00:18.525
# 大的有两三斤三四斤的也有
Some bigger ones can weigh around 2 to 4 Jin (1 to 2kg)_

00:00:20.700,00:00:23.550
# 我们这个棒菜在四川来说产量非常地高
"Bang Cai" is a very high-yield vegetable in Sichuan


00:00:24.600,00:00:26.550
# 就是春节前后（登市）
(It appears on the market) around Chinese New Year


00:00:26.725,00:00:29.075
# 因为春节前后大家大鱼大肉吃多了
Because people are bored of eating so much fish and meat during Chinese New Year


00:00:29.075,00:00:30.900
# 然后这个把皮撕掉
After peeling the skin off,


00:00:30.900,00:00:35.775
# 用它来清煮或者说加一些腊味下去煮
we can steam it or make a stew with some Chinese cured meat


00:00:35.775,00:00:38.350
# 煮出来这个菜的口感很软
It turns soft after boiling

00:00:38.350,00:00:41.300
# 就是特别的鲜 汤比较鲜
and the soup is full of umami flavour


00:00:41.875,00:00:43.750
# 然后这个
Then this,

00:00:44.450,00:00:47.625
# 这个看起来有点棱棱角角的
which looks quite irregular,

00:00:47.625,00:00:49.625
# 在我们四川这个叫菱角菜

00:00:55.975,00:01:01.250
# 同样的它这个也是一样把这个老的皮给它撕掉
Similarly we remove the skin by tearing it

00:01:01.400,00:01:05.850
# 吃法的话就比这个棒菜多一种吃法
but it has one more way to cook compared to "Bang Cai"

00:01:05.900,00:01:09.450
# 它可以用来凉拌也可以用来煮汤
We can use it to make salads and soups,


00:01:09.450,00:01:11.125

00:01:14.400,00:01:17.150
# 我们这个菱角菜呢它其实还有一个做法
There is one more way to cook "Ling Jiao Cai"

00:01:17.150,00:01:19.875
# 就是跟（竹）笋干萝卜干一样
Like dried bamboo shoots and dried raddish,

00:01:19.875,00:01:21.900
# 直接切开切开了之后晒
we can cut it and sun dry it


00:01:21.900,00:01:23.400
# 晒成干的东西
until it's fully dried


00:01:23.400,00:01:26.000
# 然后我们吃的时候再拿出来泡
Soak it in water before cooking


00:01:26.000,00:01:29.925
# 把它（泡）发好了不管是用来炒也好 用来炖也好
and, after it rehydrates, we can either stir fry and stew it


00:01:30.275,00:01:31.800
# 或者是凉拌也好
or simply serve it cold as a salad


00:01:31.825,00:01:35.825
# 然后我们这个菜的话跟另外两样它比起来的话
Compared to the other two types of vegetables,


00:01:35.875,00:01:37.925

Because of those many large branches

00:01:57.000,00:01:58.800
# 也叫做儿菜
It's also called "Er Cai" (literally "sons vegetable")

00:01:58.800,00:02:03.100
# 就是说除了一根茎上来之外它像花瓣一样
Because those branches grow from a single stem, like petals of a flower

00:02:03.100,00:02:06.300
# 会朝四边发展出很多“儿子”出来
And those branches are like sons to the steam, expanding in different directions

00:02:06.300,00:02:07.575

# 然后大的话可以到七八斤 十多斤的也有
Bigger ones can weigh around 7 to 8 Jin (3.5-4kg), or even 10Jin (5kg).


00:02:21.975,00:02:24.050
# 因为比较实在嘛 长得比较实在
As it is not hollow,

00:02:25.025,00:02:26.675
# 基本上都是实心的
and it's almost solid inside (therefore weighs a lot)

00:02:27.150,00:02:28.450

It is planted at many places


00:02:28.575,00:02:31.475

00:02:36.425,00:02:39.850
# 就像那个萝卜丝一样放点盐给它出一下水
Add some salt to draw water out, just as what we do with radish juliennes

# 然后再加辣椒啊红油啊盐啊白糖这些拌一下来吃
Then add some chillies, red oil (chilli oil) and white sugar to mix and eat

# 我们这个儿菜呢还有一个吃法就是
Another way to cook "Er Cai"

00:02:47.350,00:02:52.775
# 把这个上面的儿把它弄下来 弄下来做泡菜
is to cut off those branches and make pickled vegetables

00:02:52.775,00:02:55.975
# 就是像泡萝卜这些跳水菜
All those pickled vegetables, like pickled radish,

00:02:55.975,00:03:00.075
# 就是直接泡一下短时间就可以吃
can be prepared within a short amount of time

00:03:12.350,00:03:16.600
# 但这种东西的话只有在我们四川吃得比较多

Because, firstly, they are cheap


00:03:19.375,00:03:21.075

00:03:21.075,00:03:25.750
# 然后我们这里特别喜欢把它弄来煮汤来吃
We like to add them to soup

00:03:25.750,00:03:26.800

to enhance the umami flavor

00:03:27.100,00:03:29.744
# 如果想吃得清淡一点的话就直接用来煮水
If you prefer mild tasting food, you can just boil them with water
