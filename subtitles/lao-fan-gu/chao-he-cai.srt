# 【国宴大师•老北京炒合菜】烙个春饼卷来吃，滑嫩爽脆溢韭香，营养美味又强身健体的菜来喽！|老饭骨
# [Master Chefs • Beijing Style Chao He Cai] Together with wraps, it tastes very very good 

# 小友们好，今天老饭骨给你们带来一个节令性强的菜品：炒合菜•卷春饼。
# My dear friends, today we are bringing you a seasonal dish: Chao He Cai• with wraps

# 炒合菜，是北京市传统的特色名菜，属于京菜系，在北方也是一种讲究的菜品。
# Chao He Cai is Beijing's traditional dish, and also a delicate Northern dish.

# 这道菜有两个个特点：一是节令性强，立春日必不可少；
# 二是吃“炒合菜”需要春饼卷食，方能品出味道。
# This dish has two characteristics: first is that it's seasonal, a must have in Li Chun (Beginning of Spring).
# Second is that it needs to be eaten with wraps, to bring out it's intended taste.

# 它将胡萝卜，韭菜、肉丝、粉丝、豆芽菜、小菠菜等一起炒制，
# 成菜肉丝滑嫩，豆芽爽脆，菠菜多汁，
# 和粉丝一起组合成爽口多汁含有复合口感的味道，
# 再配上蛋饼，以春饼卷食，真是妙哉啊！
# It has carrots, chives, meat strips, vermicelli, bean sprouts and baby spinach.
# This dish combines tender meat shreds, crunchy bean sprouts and juicy baby spinach.
# Together with vermicelli, they form a complex layers of flavor.
# With some fried eggs, wrapped together, what a delicious dish!

# 取猪通脊切成丝状，葱姜水腌制去腥增香，
# 加入盐，胡椒粉，蛋清，玉米淀粉，上浆刨肉，再用油封。
# Take pork tenderloin and julienne it, marinate with ginger and scallion juice to get rid of bad smells.
# Add salt, ground peppercorn, egg white and corn starch to coat, and then seal with oil.


# 之后用三成热油来滑肉丝后捞出，剩下的油用花椒，姜，葱爆香，
# 放入胡萝卜、豆芽菜，小菠菜、粉丝，
# 肉丝、再放入肉丝炒制，先烹酒后搁盐，最后放韭菜。
# Stir fry julienned pork in 30% hot oil, drain out and rest on the side.
# Infuse the rest of the oil with peppercorns, ginger and scallions.
# Add in carrots, bean sprouts, baby spinach, vermicelli,
# meat shreds, and then cook with wine then salt. Lastly add chives. 

# 其中的知识点：切肉丝的手法为什么会像螃蟹一样？三叔为你解答疑惑。
# 熟悉老饭骨的朋友们知道，油封已多次在不同视频中出现了，为什么肉丝需要用油封？
# 为何先放菜再放肉？最后放韭菜的目的是什么？
# Techniques in it: why does the hand move like a crab when julienning pork? San Shu will answer it for you.
# Our old friends must know about oil-sealing, which has been shown in some of our other videos. Why do we seal the meat with oil?
# And reasons of ingredients ordering: why add veggies before meat, and add chives last.

# 当然，这道菜卷春饼也是一大特色。
# 烙饼并没有太多的难度，这道菜的重点在于要保留面饼和菜的香味冲撞的复合味道，
# 所以面饼不应擀得太薄，小友们一定注意！
# Of course, wraps are a special part of this dish, 
# The making of wraps is not too hard. The key to success in this dish is the combined flavor of veggies and flour.
# As such, wraps shouldn't be rolled too thin.

# 这些都是做菜的小秘诀，大家可要记笔记呀！
# These are the secrets in cooking this dish, make sure you note these down!
